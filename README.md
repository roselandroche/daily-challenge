# Daily Challenge

This repo will serve as a library of code challenge solutions I develop on a daily basis.

## Goals:

- Solve a new code challenge everyday
- Consistently improve the speed and memory usage of my solutions
- Increase my fluency in JavaScript and Python
- Discover areas to focus on and improve

  - I overestimated the amount of work needed for a solution. I was knee deep in defining classes and helper functions when I stopped to check how other coders had accessed the lists in the params. This led to the solution above being pulled from another user for me to look over and understand. I definitely need to work on linked lists a lot.

  - I fully fleshed this out on my own, and debugged all errors. I feel much better about this than yesterday's code, and am feeling more comfortable with this data structure. I did not create a test file for this one, but tested all the code within the js file manually.
